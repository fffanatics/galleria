This project is an attempt to make a photo gallery website from
various different types of programming languages. The 6 languages
that I am currently working with are the following:

1. Python (Google AppEngine)
2. PHP (Native/Heroku)
3. Ruby (Native/Heroku)
4. Node.js/HTML5 (Native/Heroku)
5. iOS (Objective C)
6. Android (Java)

My goals are to learn the above languages and platforms while
implementing the following features:

1. Displaying of albums
2. Displaying of pictures inside albums
3. Upload interface
4. Admin interface
5. Meta data about photos (EXIF)
6. Basic views/commenting/rating system
7. Optimized loading/viewing
8. Similar functionality to Picasaweb
